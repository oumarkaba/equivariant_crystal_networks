These datafiles were gathered by intern Marc-Antoine Gauthier.
Most were taken from McGill's IMAT project (Pr. Ong Guo)

Adomic radius [pm] taken from McGill's IMAT project. Correspond roughly 
(complete verification still needed) to Wikipedia's 'covalent radius (single
bond)' data of the 'Atomic radii of the elements (data page)' page.

Cohesive energy [eV/atom] taken from McGill's IMAT project 
Correspond to the values in Kittel's book

The valence data is different on Wikipedia, in the IMAT project, and in Magpie
In fact, IMAT's atomic valence radius may corresponds to wiki's valence number

I didn't find the affinity data elsewhere.

I didn't find the binding energy data elsewhere.
